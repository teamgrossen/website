# Welcome to our lab!

The lab of Daniel Croll wants to understand how pathogens evolve to cause disease. For this, we mainly focus on major crop pathogens to unravel mechanisms of rapid adaptation. We want to understand how host resistance mechanisms are circumvented, pesticides become ineffective and how pathogens cope with climate challenges. We take a broad view in our work and have strong interests in evolutionary processes at all levels from selfish elements to genomes and broad species comparisons. We also have a passion for projects related to conservation genomics. We combine computational work with empirical analyses from the field to the bench.

We are at the University of Neuchâtel (Switzerland) and run the [Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.unine.ch/evobot/lab_evol_genet.html)

Many of the world’s staple crops are vulnerable to the emergence of new pathogens. Our group investigates how pathogens emerge on crops, gain virulence and reshape their genome in the process.

We are a diverse group of people combining skills in evolutionary biology, microbiology, bioinformatics and genomics. We also like to laugh and have fun.
