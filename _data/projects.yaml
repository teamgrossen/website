  description: Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) are an excellent model to investigate the population genomic consequences of profound bottlenecks. As a consequence of centuries-long strong hunting pressure, Alpine ibex nearly went extinct at the beginning of the 19th century, but recovered thanks to a very successful reintroduction program. We combine ancient, historic and modern samples spanning a period of more than 12000 years to investigate the consequences of near extinction (and locally frequent hybridisation with Domestic goat) on the genomic makeup of a species.
