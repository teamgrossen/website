  description: Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) are an excellent model to investigate the population genomic consequences of profound bottlenecks. As a consequence of centuries-long strong hunting pressure, Alpine ibex nearly went extinct at the beginning of the 19th century, but recovered thanks to a very successful reintroduction program. We combine ancient, historic and modern samples spanning a period of more than 12000 years to investigate the consequences of near extinction (and locally frequent hybridisation with Domestic goat) on the genomic makeup of a species.

  description: European Wildcats are currently recovering in Switzerland after having almost completely disappeared in the middle of the 20th century. Due to a range expansion, the species gets increasingly into contact with Domestic cats and mate with them resulting in fertile hybrids. We perform genome-wide analyses of introgression and mutation load in Wildcats and hybrids to improve our understanding, how well hybrids cope with their mixed ancestry of a wild and a domesticated species and how hybridisation may affect the long-term survivability of Wildcats.
