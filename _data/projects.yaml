  description: European Wildcats are currently recovering in Switzerland after having almost completely disappeared in the middle of the 20th century. Due to a range expansion, the species gets increasingly into contact with Domestic cats and mate with them resulting in fertile hybrids. We perform genome-wide analyses of introgression and mutation load in Wildcats and hybrids to improve our understanding, how well hybrids cope with their mixed ancestry of a wild and a domesticated species and how hybridisation may affect the long-term survivability of Wildcats.
