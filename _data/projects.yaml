  description: Alpine ibex suffered from a population bottleneck of a few hundred individuals caused by overhunting. The species was reestablished across the Alps and counts again around 40â€™000 individuals. We showed that Alpine ibex received genetic material from domestic goats through hybridization and introgression. A process that was likely favored by the population bottleneck. We are also interested in the consequences of population bottlenecks on the fate of deleterious mutations.

  description: Bearded vultures were exterminated in the Alps in the 19th century. The species was successfully reintroduced in the Alps and counts now around 200 individuals. We are interested in the genetic health of the reintroduced population and possible effects of inbreeding on fitness.
